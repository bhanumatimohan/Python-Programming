File handling is an important part of any web application.
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file :
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
